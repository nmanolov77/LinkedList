# LinkedList

Implementation of LinkedList. Using only 2 global variables, next and value, this is my attempt of building a functioning Linked List data structure. This Java class includes methods to initialize, link, and manipulate the list. While this isn't the most effecient data structure, it is functional. Methods include next, last, after, detach, get, set, setNext, append and insert and 2 constructors.
